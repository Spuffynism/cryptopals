# cryptopals

(An attempt at) solving the [cryptopals crypto challenges](https://cryptopals.com)

# Intro

Solutions are unit tests in [set1.rs](src/set1.rs), [set2.rs](src/set2.rs), set{set_number}.rs files in their respective `tests` module.

Run them with `cargo test challenge` and run all tests with `cargo test`

# TODO

- Rename challenge names to the form of `challenge_{nb}_{name_of_challenge}`
- Set 3 challenge 20
